# Rust Learning Journey - Tutor Notes

## Student Profile

- **Name:** Thomas
- **Background:** Experienced developer. Knows systems languages (C++ — but rusty, ~10 years ago) and managed/GC languages (Java, C#, Python, JS/TS, etc.)
- **Systems concepts:** Comfortable but rusty — understands memory management, pointers, stack/heap, concurrency in theory but hasn't practiced hands-on in a long time.
- **Rust experience:** Complete beginner — never written Rust.
- **Interests:** Broad — CLI tools, web/APIs, systems/low-level, data/automation. All fair game for projects.
- **Learning approach:** Project-based. Explore the Rust ecosystem hands-on.
- **Learning style:** Prefers to execute commands himself rather than having tutor run them. Hands-on learner. Asks good "why" questions (e.g., asked about curl flags before blindly running the install script). Wants class notes stored for future reference.

## Curriculum Plan

### Project 1: `rgrep` — mini grep clone (CLI tool)

**Concepts:** cargo, types, ownership, borrowing, structs, enums, pattern matching, error handling, traits, file I/O, iterators, closures, testing.
**Status:** Just started — project scaffolded with `cargo new`.

### Project 2: Data processing tool (TBD)

**Concepts:** iterators, generics, serde, file I/O, testing.

### Project 3: Web API (TBD)

**Concepts:** async Rust, tokio, axum/actix, database access.

### Project 4: Systems-level project (TBD)

**Concepts:** concurrency, unsafe, FFI, performance.

## Session Log

### Class 01 — 2026-02-16

- Initial meeting. Gathered background info.
- Installed Rust via rustup (1.93.1).
- Discussed curl install command flags in detail (--proto, --tlsv1.2, -sSf).
- Discussed how .cargo/env gets sourced in .zshrc.
- Introduced Project 1: `rgrep`.
- Covered cargo basics: `cargo new`, `cargo run`, `cargo build`, `cargo check`, `cargo build --release`.
- Explained Cargo.toml and project structure.
- See [class01.md](class01.md) for full notes.

## Notes & Observations

- Student wants project-based learning to explore the Rust ecosystem.
- Prefers running commands himself — don't execute for him, give him the commands to run.
- Asks clarifying questions before proceeding — thorough learner.
- Wants class notes in classXX.md files for future reference.
